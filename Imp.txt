*****************************************************************JAVA IMP POINTS****************************************************************************

1.  a non-static Method can call another non-static method Directly(WITHOUT CREATING ANY OBJECT)
2.  any method can call in any method
3.  There should be only one public class
4.  Recursion is not possible(a method cannot call itself)
5.  We cannot call a method of One class in another class Directly(Without creating an Object)

*Constructor :-
-------------
1.it is a special method which has the same name as the class name
2.it does not have any return type not even void 
3.it gets called automatically whenever you create an Object
4.it is used to initialize the values

*this KeyWord:-
--------------
1.this keyword refers to current Object.
2.in constructor Overloading Concept this() keyword is used.

*String:-
---------
1.class-java.lang package.
2.String is immutable(Not changeble).
3.String is Array of Characters.
4.lot of useful methods
5. string is Thread Safe
6.it is a special class we can access this without creating any Objects

*StringBuffer is similar to String but it is not ThreadSafe
*Method Overloading means writing already existing method with different parameters

Static Block :-
----------------
1.In simpler language whenever we use a static keyword and associate it to a block then that 
block is referred to as a static block. Unlike C++, Java supports a special block, called a
static block (also called static clause) that can be used for static initialization of a class.
This code inside the static block is executed only once: the first time the class is loaded into memory.
